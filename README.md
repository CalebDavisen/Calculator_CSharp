# Calculator_CSharp

##**What is it**
This is a basic calculator that allows simple functions like addition, subtraction, and division.  The user inputs two numbers in the text boxes labeled _First number_ & _Second number_ then selects the operation that they wish to use. After clicking the operation they want the program uses the inputted numbers and the selected operation and displays the operation and results in the list box at the bottom. When the user wishes to clear the list box they are able to click the clear button to reset the box.

##**What I learned**
While completing this project I learned how to use multiple buttons and have multiple events with different code to run for each.  I was able to use information that the user would input and complete the task that they wish to complete.
